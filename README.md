### Reflections

1.  In the first module, I learned about TypeScript, its installation `npm install typescript`, generating TypeScript configuration files with `tsc --init`, configuring tsconfig.json, and compiling .ts files using `tsc`.
2.  In Module 02, I learned that TypeScript allows adding static types to JavaScript code, with all types being subtypes of a top type known as the **any** type. Additionally, I gained insights into **primitive types** like boolean, number, string, void, including null, and undefined, as well as **object types** such as class, interface, array, and literal types.
3.  In Module 03, I delved into TypeScript **interfaces**, learning how to use them to define and describe object types, parameterize types, compose new types, declare and instantiate interfaces, extend existing interfaces, and declare interfaces with custom array types.
4.  In Module 04, I learned to create functions with **required, optional, default, and rest parameters**, define function types using **type aliases or interfaces**, and how TypeScript facilitates function development by enabling parameter and return value typing, which simplifies troubleshooting.
5.  In Module 05, I learned how to use TypeScript **classes** to define object shapes, declare and instantiate classes, apply access modifiers and static properties, extend classes, and ensure class shape with **interfaces**, gaining insight into when to use interfaces versus classes for defining object structures.
6.  In Module 06, I gained proficiency in identifying use cases for **generics**, defining generic functions, interfaces, and classes, and implementing generic constraints, enhancing my ability to write flexible and reusable code in TypeScript.
