## My TypeScript Journey: Earned Badges 

### Badges Overview

Here is a collection of badges I earned from completing Microsoft Learn's TypeScript modules:

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**: [Badge]([badge-link](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/hannakulikowska/QDAPSSBE?sharingId=D035CDB343F03AE7))
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/api/achievements/share/en-us/hannakulikowska/WACAVURN?sharingId=D035CDB343F03AE7)



### Reflections

1.  In the first module, I learned about TypeScript, its installation `npm install typescript`, generating TypeScript configuration files with `tsc --init`, configuring tsconfig.json, and compiling .ts files using `tsc`.
2.  In Module 02, I learned that TypeScript allows adding static types to JavaScript code, with all types being subtypes of a top type known as the **any** type. Additionally, I gained insights into **primitive types** like boolean, number, string, void, including null, and undefined, as well as **object types** such as class, interface, array, and literal types.
